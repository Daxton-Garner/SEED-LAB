  Arduino: Move according to the states given by Pi calculations
  Pi: Phase machine determining marker position (angle and distance)
  This demo contains a method for the robot to search for a marker, approach the marker, and make a circle around the marker.

Pi:
  The Code uses a state machine to communicate to the Arduino what movements to make next. The machine starts in state
  0.5, where the Arduino will move the robot around to an angle where the marker can be seen. Once the marker is detected
  by the pi, the state is changed to state 1 and the Arduino continues moving in the same way. Once the marker is in the
  center of the screen, the state is changed to 3 and the robot will move forward until it is within 1 foot of the marker.
  At this point, control is then in the hands of the Arduino to either stop or circle around the marker. Throughout this
  process, the arduino and pi are sending number codes to ensure correct states and movement between states.
