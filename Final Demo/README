This folder contains demo 2 code we will use for the final demo, as well as some test code for the actual
  final demo project.

  FinalDemoArduino - This houses our arduino code that runs the controls and localization of our robot throught the whole demo


Arduino:
  This code has a state machine that has 7 different states. The code starts by using I2C to listen to what state the PI is wanting the 
robot to be in. State 1 has the wheel turn opposite of eachother to make McSEED rotate CCW so the camera can find and detect the marker. 
One the marker is striaght in front of the robot we switch to state 2 which cause the wheel is move straight forward, whener the robot gets 
off course the PI will either send a state 6 to vear left or 7 for right. Once it gets within a foot of the marker the Pi sends it a state 3
Which has the arduino tell the PI what state it wants to be in by setting "TalktoPi = 1." This then allows the state to be turned to 4 and 
has the arduino use our PI controler to turn 90 degrees CW. Once compelted we make "TalktoPi = 2," allowing the state to become 5. The fifth
state has it opperate a perfect
