  miniprojArucoDetect: Code for Pi to detect aruco markers and send location of 
                       markers to Arduino

Project summary:
  This project uses Aruco markers to tell a wheel where to spin to. A raspberry pi
  uses a camera to detect the location of an Aruco marker in the capture, then 
  returns a number corresponding to the location. This number is sent to the Arduino,
  which will then tell to which angle the wheel will spin. The Aruco locations and
  returned numbers are as follows:
    Northwest = 1
    Northeast = 2
    Southeast = 3
    Southwest = 4
  The Arduino utilizes localization and control to move the wheel to the correct 
  location. <DAXTON OR TREVOR NEEDS TO ADD SOMETHING HERE ABOUT HOW THIS HAPPENS>
  The Arduino then communicates with the Pi to tell the pi where the wheel is 
  currently in it's rotation. This, along with the desired location, is displayed 
  on the Pi's LCD screen.

This project also included setting up this GitHub repository.
