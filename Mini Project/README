Folder Contents
  miniProjControl Folder: Code to control the motor so it goes to the right spot when it is told to
  miniProjPiArduinoComms Folder: This code file is what we used to help understand comminucation between
                                 the Arduino and the pi
  ArduinoCommunication: This file holds both the IDE code and the matlab code that we used so Matlab 
                        could read Arduino data
  Position_Controller: This is our Simulink file with our PI controller
  ReadFromArduino: This is the Matlab file that comes out when you extract ArduinoCommunication
  miniprojArucoDetect: Code for Pi to detect aruco markers and send location of 
                       markers to Arduino

Project summary:
  This project uses Aruco markers to tell a wheel where to spin to. A raspberry pi
  uses a camera to detect the location of an Aruco marker in the capture, then 
  returns a number corresponding to the location. This number is sent to the Arduino,
  which will then tell to which angle the wheel will spin. The Aruco locations and
  returned numbers are as follows:
    Northwest = 1, go to 
    Northeast = 2, go to 
    Southeast = 3, go to 
    Southwest = 4, go to 
  The Arduino utilizes localization and control to move the wheel to the correct 
  location. By using the motor's current position the arduino is able to calculate
  its needed angular velocity. This velocity will ramp up and then slow down once
  it gets to the proper position. We are using a PI controller to give us a good
  rise time without having too much of a overshoot. The Arduino then communicates 
  with the Pi to tell the pi where the wheel is currently in it's rotation. This, 
  along with the desired location, is displayed on the Pi's LCD screen.

This project also included setting up this GitHub repository.
