Pi:
  The code in the Raspberry Pi section of the demo determines where a 5cm marker is on the screen
  It uses a calibration to find the distance the marker is from the camera. It then uses the known 
  width of the marker (5cm) and the number of pixels wide the marker is to find a ratio and calculate 
  the left to right distance from the center of the camera. Each of these distances are then used
  to calculate the angle of the marker compared the the center of the camera. This angle is then
  sent to the LCD screen.
